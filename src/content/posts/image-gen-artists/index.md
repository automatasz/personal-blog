# The style of Ukiyo-e (浮世絵)

Ukiyo-e (浮世絵) is a traditional Japanese art form that originated in the Edo period (17th to 19th centuries). The term "ukiyo-e" translates to "pictures of the floating world." Ukiyo-e art captures scenes of daily life, landscapes, historical events, kabuki theater, beautiful women, and famous actors. These woodblock prints were mass-produced and widely distributed, making art more accessible to the general population.
